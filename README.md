## 💁 About me
##### Hi! After more than 8 years as a technical consultant and IT coordinator I decided to change my life and start working about I really passionate me, programming. It was a hard decission, but now I can say I did the right thing, because you have to fight for what you are passionate about, and overall, you have to work on something that motivates you and makes you improve every day.

##### Nowadays I am working as Software Developer at Next Digital Hub (consulting startup). Mainly we work in responsive web applications with a modern stack (Backend: Spring Boot - Fronend: VUE), applying continuous integration with GitLab CI. Back is tested (unit, integration and acceptance tests) with JUnit, Mockito and Object Mother pattern.

##### The previous job was at Qindel, working for Inditex, making improvements and corrections on the payment plattform.
